# StableDiffusion_GUIApp
A Flask GUI application that lets users input text prompts, generates images using Stable Diffusion via a Hugging Face API, and displays the result with a download option.   
This project is also containerized with Docker for easy deployment. You can pull the image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/amirhofo/stable-diffusion-app).
